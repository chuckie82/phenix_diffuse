NOTE #2: this code is written within the framework of the Computational Crystallography Toolbox python library (http://cctbx.sourceforge.net/) and thus will not work with standard Python distributions


*****************************************************

Description
This program calculates reciprocal space diffuse scattering maps from multi-model PDB ensembles.

Output
MTZ file containing diffuse scattering intensity values (I) at each Bragg peak

Command line Usage
phenix.diffuse pdb=test.pdb probabilities=0.3,0.3,0.3,0.1 resolution=4.0 prefix=my_map

pdb: input PDB file. At least one CRYST1 symmetry description is required.

probabilities: the weighted probability for each model in the corresponding PDB file. The values listed in this option will be assigned to the PDB models starting with MODEL 0. Alternatively, leaving out the probabilities option will lead to equal weights for each model in the PDB file.

resolution: the desired d_min for the output MTZ map

prefix: the desired MTZ file name
